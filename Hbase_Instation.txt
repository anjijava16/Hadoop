Inside the hbase-site.xml(We need to set up the ClusterMode

========================================================
If we runn interal zooker it is generated the below pah files
work/zoo_data:
==> Data direct path should exists
==> myid file should exists
    inside the data dir path

Inside the my id file zookper server id should there(0,1,2)
Hbase : have interanl zookeper(that is totally taken care by Hmaster)
    Bydefault internal zookper (we no need to install zookeper)
   If we running into the Cluster mode we need to set the JAVA_HOME inside the hbase-env.sh set the JDK7 path


i) Starting the Order
           i)Zookeper ,HMaster,HRS
ii) Stopping order
          HRS,HM,ZK

IN a cluster mode Zookper is start the first  order of the Starting not happne won't work properly

 Running HQuoramPeer (means ZookKeeper)




External ZookPer working: (Normal Zookper (QuoramPeer
========================================

verify : echo $zookeeper

zoo.cfg : Inside this file last 3 lines (dataDir,clientPort,server.1)
         server.1=localhost:2888:3888 (PeerPorta,leaderPort)

create zoo_data folder 

to Make export HBASE_MANAGES_ZK=false ( bcoz we using external zookper) at the restart the hbase at the it is running HMaster,HRS


Practle : Interal purpose (CLuster with interanl)
Proudction: Exeranl cluster (External zookper)
